	<h2>Humans Need Not Apply</h2>
	<h3>By Brendan C. DePuy</h3>

	<p>In the video, "Humans Need Not Apply", the general claim is that humas will start to become dull and gets replaced by technology.  Many people have decided to become programmers and engineers, whose job is to build mechanical minds.  Their muscles made human labor less in demand so are mechanical minds making human brain labor less in demand.  A general computer can be as easily calculate change or assign seats on an airplane or play a game or do anything by swapping software.  This huge demand for computers makes it cheaper every year.  The city jobs were very easy, with many humans in the cities, which allowed more jobs for horses.  Since 2000, there are still working horses, but wre nothing like a century ago.  The horse population reached its height in 1915, from that point on it decreased.   </p>
	<p> Now there are many jobs, but the new jobs are not as significant to jobs that have been around for many decades.  There a sobering jobs with the transportation industry at the top. Many of this work exsisted a century ago and these jobs were targets for automation. </p>

	<P>I agree with the fact that robots will end up taking most of our jobs.I also agree with this statement "Since 2000, there are still working horses, but wre nothing like a century ago. The horse population reached its height in 1915, from that point on it decreased.

	<h2> Blown to Bits</h2>

	<p> In the section, "The Explosion of Bits, and Everything Else," the story talks about how efficient modern computers are keeping track of information and data.  The authour is telling that the world is going to become completely opposite anything human history has witnessed before.  The information you put online has the ability to be saved and distributed to everyone in the world.</p>
	<p> In the section, "The Koans of Bits," it talks about how information in a computer is malleable because it is ones and zeros.  Also, exponential growth can become a lot a whole quicker than one may think. Finally, the news and information can be gathered about an event in our own city before we even know what is happening.</p>
	<p> In the section, "Footprints and Fingerprints," the story talks about how we live our fingerprints and footprints day by day. People do not even realize that we are leaving them as we open doors and drink out of a tumbler.  </p>
	<p> The content is telling people that the information in this article tells us that there are footprints and fingerprints surrounding our environment.</p>

		<p> I decided to interview my mom because she uses technology for work almost everyday.</p>

		<p class="brendan_lines"><span class="brendan">Brendan</span>: How old were you got your first computer?</p>
		<p><span class="mary">Mary</span>: My brother was a freshman in college, when he got his first desktop.  It was fall of 1991.  I was a high school senior when I first got access to a computer at home.  Since he lived at home, I was able to use it too.  Before that, I had a word processor which was basically an electronic typewriter with limited memory.</p>


		<p class="brendan_lines"><span class="brendan">Brendan</span>: What was your favorite piece of technology when they were growing up?</p>
		<p><span class="mary">Mary</span>: My favorite piece of technology was my VCR.  You could watch movies at home and you could tape things that are on TV.  There was nothing worse than missing a good part of a show because you were in the bathroom.</p> 


		<p class="brendan_lines"><span class="brendan">Brendan</span>: How has technology changed over your lifetime?</p>
		<p><span class="mary">Mary</span>: It has changed dramatically.  I went from growing up in a house with a rotary phone to a touchtone phone.  I knew the frustration of a busy signal.  Then in law school, I had a pager which would let you know when someone was trying to get a hold of you.  We went from there to flip phones to sidekicks, which were cellphones with larger keyboards for texting.  Now, I carry around an iPhone, which is basically a mini computer, at all times.</p>


		<p class="brendan_lines"><span class="brendan">Brendan</span>: Have the changes you’ve seen in technology over your lifetime mostly helped or hurt society?</p>
		<p><span class="mary">Mary</span>: In some ways, they have helped, but in some ways they have hurt.  On the one hand, it is great that you can always reach someone in case of emergency.  Also, there have been great developments in the medical field by using technology.  In addition, the internet is a valuable resource.  On the other hand, the development of technology has weakened our social skills as a society.  People don’t talk to each other as much, especially kids.  My son plays video games with his friends online instead of seeing his friends in person.  In addition, I far prefer reading a book as opposed to reading on a computer screen.  Even at work, I do my legal research online instead of from books and my files are uploaded instead of paper files.  Whie, I understand the environment is important, I find it easier to comprehend when I am reading when I am holding a paper.  Finally, one huge downside of technology are sites like YouTube, which can have some very inappropriate content available to all.</p>  



		<p class="brendan_lines"><span class="brendan">Brendan</span>: What is your greatest hope for technology in the future?</p>
		<p><span class="mary">Mary</span>: It can be used to solve problems, like our city’s crumbling infrastructure and it could be a great conduit for accurate information sharing.</p>

		<p class="brendan_lines"><span class="brendan">Brendan</span>: What is your greatest fear of technology in the future?</p>
		<p><span class="mary">Mary</span>: It will lead to the demise of social skills, interpersonal relationships, and communities in general.  Also, as we have already seen with our elections, technology can be weaponized such as by cyber attacks and election meddling.  Finally, I worry that one day we will reach the point where we cannot tell if information is accurate or not.</p> 


		<p class="brendan_lines"><span class="brendan">Brendan</span>: What advice would you like to share with the younger generation about technology?</p>
		<p><span class="mary">Mary</span>: My advice would be that the younger generation not rely on technology so heavily.  It should be an aid, not the entirety of your day.  Also, you shouldn’t text or post a comment that is mean, that is something you wouldn’t say to the person’s face, or that is something you wouldn’t want your parents to see. Trust me - when you apply to college or apply to a job, one of the first things that is going to be done is a Google search of you and or a social media search of you.  Finally, if you are having a problem with someone or a fight, talk to the person face to face or over the phone.  Technology cannot convey emotion and texts can be easily misread when you are upset.  Don’t wear headphones in the workplace unless your supervisor tells you it is okay to do so, or you have an accommodation for that.</p>  

		<p class="brendan_lines"><span class="brendan">Brendan</span>: What are your favorite benefits of technology?</p>
		<p><span class="mary">Mary</span>: Number 1 would have to be the Starbucks Mobile App.  I love being able to order my coffee in advance and then picking it up.  Online shopping is very handy, and was very helpful to doing Christmas shopping when you and your brother were young.  However, I think there needs to be a balance between online shops and brick and mortar stores.</p>
